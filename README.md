# delivery_robot
*This project showcases a delivery robot system that utilizes the MPU6050 sensor for angle detection and control. By integrating the MPU6050 with the delivery robot, we enhance its ability to maintain a straight trajectory during transportation.
*This project uses STM32F103C8T6 MCU which connects some peripherals to help robot detect do some basic task of whole robot.
*Some peripheral 
          *   **- HC-05 (Bluetooth)**
          *  **- HCSR-04 (Ultrasonic sensor)**
          *   **- MPU6050 (IMU module)**
          *   **- L298N (Driver motor)**
          *   **- LCD (Option)**
          *   **- Voltage stabilizer circuit (Option)**
