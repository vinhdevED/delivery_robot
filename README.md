# Delivery Robot work indoor (Factory)  
## ü§ñ Problem 
- Big problem: The earphone manufacturing factory is facing challenges, such as increasing demand, rising labor costs, and the need for transporting electronic parts between some sections. A shipping robot that can automate the shipping process would help to address these challenges.
## üê¥ Requirement
+ The robot must be able to navigate autonomously in earphone manufacturing factory, 
+ The robot must be able to identify and avoid workers  
+ The robot not only uses wireless communication, for example, bluetooth or wifi, but also has to connect to the mobile app
+ It can pick up and deliver packages, specifically a headset box under 500g
+ as tracking positon, it can detect coordinate
+ Especially, The weight and costs are under 2.5 kg and under 2 million vnd

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview  
+This project showcases a delivery robot system that utilizes the MPU6050 sensor for angle detection and control. By integrating the MPU6050 with the delivery robot, we enhance its ability to maintain a straight trajectory during transportation.  
+This project uses STM32F103C8T6 MCU which connects some peripherals to help robot detect do some basic task of whole robot.  
## üì¶ Installation
