# Delivery Robot work indoor (Factory)  
## üó∫Ô∏è Overview  
+This project showcases a delivery robot system that utilizes the MPU6050 sensor for angle detection and control. By integrating the MPU6050 with the delivery robot, we enhance its ability to maintain a straight trajectory during transportation.  
+This project uses STM32F103C8T6 MCU which connects some peripherals to help robot detect do some basic task of whole robot.  
## üì¶ Installation  
Easy clone this project and open in STM32Cube IDE
